## Scalability

Since we're using `Kubernetes` via `EKS` then we can leverage all the Scaling Goodness such as `karpenter` which allows the application to scale `horizontally` also we will enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).

*NOTE:* There's also `Autoscaling` from `AWS` and [Predictive Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html) to consider as alternative for `karpenter`
