## Monitoring

* Ideally if we can use `datadog` for monitoring (this has a rich set of features and can integrate with `AWS` seamlessly) 
  * if not then `CloudWatch` and other `Services` from AWS should also work.  
  * Another feature from `EKS Blueprint` is we can enable `prometheus` for Cluster Metrics.
